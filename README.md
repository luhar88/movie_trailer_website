# Movie Trailer Website

The application shows the list of your favourite movies. The application will generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers


###To run the project

Navigate to the project directory, and run the entertainment_center.py i.e.:

```
$ python entertainment_center.py
```

This will generate a file fresh_tomatoes.html where you can browse your favourite movies and their trailors when you open fresh_tomatoes.html in a browser :)
